## My process
First, I structured the HTML content. Then, I applied Tailwind CSS classes for styling and visualization. Afterward, I added the fonts and colors. Initially, all these steps were focused on the desktop version of the page. Finally, I added media queries to ensure the page is responsive on smaller devices, particularly mobile phones. And voil√†, the page was complete!

### Built with and using
- Bun instead of Node
- React Js
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwindcss
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwindcss framework for styling
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Bun JavaScript runtime & package manager

### What I learned

During this project, I gained valuable experience with Tailwind CSS, understanding how to efficiently apply utility classes to streamline styling and ensure a responsive design. Additionally, I learned how to integrate and utilize Bun, a fast JavaScript bundler, with React.js. This involved setting up Bun in a React environment, optimizing the build process, and leveraging its performance benefits. Overall, these new skills have significantly enhanced my proficiency in modern web development tools and techniques.
